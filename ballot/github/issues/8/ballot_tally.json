It is also an option to include some other DeSci tokens such as VITA plus WETH.\r\n\r\nThe question becomes do we do a Balancer pool with a mix bag of DataFi and DeSci? Or do we do a two token pair of OCEAN/BANK on Uni?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BanklessDeSci/Governance/assets/150953662/fe8fb3b9-6485-433e-b0f7-97bc82e18067)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BanklessDeSci/Governance/assets/150953662/9504f0ee-c8a8-4c23-8fc5-8adc001ca65d)\r\n","choices":["prioritize"],"strategy":"qv","participants_group":"everybody","frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"parent_commit":"17925dac33652a24283814abe2bcec9e3caa3773"},"ballot_scores":{"prioritize":2.52},"ballot_votes_by_user":{"banklesschick":{"prioritize":{"strength":6.3504000000000005,"score":2.52}}},"ballot_accepted_votes":{"banklesschick":[{"accepted_time":"2023-11-19T18:40:14.827847978Z","accepted_vote":{"vote_id":"fytx4q2f34p4ehzgv3c2vs33yu2yvkr5pxylllndmn4jppyr7clq","vote_time":"2023-11-19T13:07:43.1544082-05:00","vote_choice":"prioritize","vote_strength_change":6.3504000000000005}}]},"ballot_rejected_votes":{"banklesschick":null},"ballot_charges":{"banklesschick":6.3504000000000005}}
