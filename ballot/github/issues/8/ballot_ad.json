It is also an option to include some other DeSci tokens such as VITA plus WETH.\r\n\r\nThe question becomes do we do a Balancer pool with a mix bag of DataFi and DeSci? Or do we do a two token pair of OCEAN/BANK on Uni?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BanklessDeSci/Governance/assets/150953662/fe8fb3b9-6485-433e-b0f7-97bc82e18067)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BanklessDeSci/Governance/assets/150953662/9504f0ee-c8a8-4c23-8fc5-8adc001ca65d)\r\n","choices":["prioritize"],"strategy":"qv","participants_group":"everybody","frozen":false,"closed":false,"cancelled":false,"parent_commit":"17925dac33652a24283814abe2bcec9e3caa3773"}
